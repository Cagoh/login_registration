# login_registration

The login web application, created with React on the front-end and SpringBoot on the back-end, follows the MVC architecture using RESTful APIs for communication, using MySql as a database to stores Users credentials. JWT tokens are utilised for stateless authentication, to ensure integrity of stored information. User accounts, each assigned roles such as ROLES_USER and ROLES_MANAGER, are securely stored in a MySQL database. Notably, users with the manager role possess access to restricted pages within the application.
